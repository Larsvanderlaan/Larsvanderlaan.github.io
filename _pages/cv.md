## Professional Experience

### Research Assistant | School of Public Health, UC Berkeley | 2020 - 2021
- Led statistical analysis in an epigenetics research group under the guidance of Professor Andres Cardenas.
- Collaborated on impactful research projects and made significant contributions to published papers.

### Summer Intern | Genentech | 2020
- Developed statistical analysis software in R for nonparametric causal inference in survival analysis using machine learning tools.
- Extracted, cleaned, and analyzed observational cancer survival data from the Flatiron database using SQL, R, and Python.
- Leveraged debiased machine learning and causal inference techniques to drive data-driven decision-making.

### Intern | Fred Hutchinson Research Center | 2020 - 2021
- Collaborated with Professor Peter B. Gilbert on research projects related to causal inference and debiased/targeted machine learning with applications to the US-sponsored COVID-19 vaccine trials.
- Developed code pipelines for a unified statistical analysis of several US Government-sponsored COVID-19 vaccine trials, including those from Moderna and Johnson & Johnson.
- Co-authored several theoretical and applied publications appearing in journals including Biometrics, Science, and Nature.

### Ph.D. Student in Statistics | University of Washington | 2021 - Present
- Conducting advanced research in several areas, including causal inference, semiparametric statistics, debiased machine learning, statistical learning theory, and calibration for heterogeneous treatment effects, and causal inference after data-driven model-selection.
- Actively collaborating with researchers at the Fred Hutchinson Research Center on projects related to causal inference and debiased machine learning with a specific focus on randomized and observational COVID-19 vaccine trials.
