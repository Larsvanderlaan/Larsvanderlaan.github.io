## Education
-- Ph.D. in Statistics, University of Washington, Seattle, 2021-current
- Master of Arts in Statistics, University of California, Berkeley, 2020
- Double Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Physics, University of Groningen, Netherlands, 2019

## Professional Experience

### Research Assistant | School of Public Health, UC Berkeley | 2020 - 2021
- Lead statistical analysis in an epigenetics research group under the guidance of Professor Andres Cardenas.
- Collaborated on impactful research projects and contributed to published papers.

### Summer Intern | Genentech | 2020
- Developed statistical analysis software in R for nonparametric causal inference in survival analysis using machine learning tools.
- Extracted, cleaned, and analyzed observational cancer survival data from the Flatiron database using SQL, R, and python.
- Leveraged debiased machine learning and causal inference to drive data-driven decision-making.

### Intern | Fred Hutchinson Research Center | 2020 - 2021
- Collaborated with Professor Peter B. Gilbert on research projects related to causal inference and debiased/targeted machine learning with applications to the US-sponsored COVID-19 vaccine trials.
- Developed code pipelines for a unified statistical analysis of several US Government-sponsored COVID-19 vaccine trials, including those from Moderna and Johnson and Johnson.
- Co-authored several theoretical and applied publications appearing journals including biometrics, Science, and Nature.

### Ph.D. Student in Statistics | University of Washington | 2021 - Present
- Conducting advanced research in both causal inference, semiparametric statistics, debiased machine learning, statistical learning theory and calibration for heterogeneous treatment effects, and causal inference after data-driven model-selection.
- Continuing collaboration with researchers at the Fred Hutchinson Research Center on causal inference and debiased machine learning with applications to randomized and observational COVID-19 vaccine trials.

## Skills

- **Programming Languages:** Proficient in Batch, Python, R, SQL, Java, and C++ for software development, data manipulation, and analysis. Familiarity with object-oriented and functional programming paradigms and committed to adhering to quality coding practices.

- **Software Development:** Experienced in developing statistical software and data tools to support research and analysis activities.

- **Ensemble and causal inference software ecosystems **: 
-- Proficient in the [tlverse](https://tlverse.org) machine learning and causal inference R ecosystem including the ensemble superlearning framework [sl3](http://tlverse.org/sl3/), dependent task parallelization framework [delayed](https://tlverse.org/delayed/), the highly adaptive lasso spline estimator package [hal9001](https://tlverse.org/hal9001/), and the generalized targeted/debiased machine learning package [hal9001](https://tlverse.org/tmle3/). 
-- Experienced with causal machine learning Python ecosystem [PyWhy](https://github.com/py-why), including EconML and doWhy.

- **Communication:** Demonstrated ability in effectively conveying complex findings to diverse audiences through excellent written and verbal communication skills. Capable of presenting technical information in a clear and understandable manner.

## Projects
-- Core contributor to the [tlverse](https://tlverse.org) machine learning and causal inference R ecosystem.
-- Contributed to the R package [tlverse/hal9001](https://tlverse.org/tmle3/) implementing the nonparametric highly adaptive lasso spline estimator. Key contributions include support for symbolic model formulae, higher order smoothness splines, and data-adaptive screening methods and scalability for high dimensional data.
-- Developed the causalglm [tlverse/causalglm](http://tlverse.org/causalglm/) for interpretable and model-robust causal inference on heterogeneous treatment effects.
