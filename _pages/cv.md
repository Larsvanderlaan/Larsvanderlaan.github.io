- Developed statistical analysis software in R for nonparametric causal inference in survival analysis using machine learning tools.
- Extracted, cleaned, and analyzed observational cancer survival data from the Flatiron database using SQL, R, and python.
- Leveraged debiased machine learning and causal inference to drive data-driven decision-making.

### Intern | Fred Hutchinson Research Center | 2020 - 2021
- Collaborated with Professor Peter B. Gilbert on research projects related to causal inference and debiased/targeted machine learning with applications to the US-sponsored COVID-19 vaccine trials.
- Developed code pipelines for a unified statistical analysis of COVID-19 vaccine trials, including those of Moderna, Johnson and Johnson,
- Co-authored several theoretical and applied publications appearing journals including biometrics, Science, and Nature.

### Ph.D. Student in Statistics | University of Washington | 2021 - Present
- Conducting advanced research in both randomized and observational causal inference with a specific focus on COVID-19 applications.
- Continuing collaboration with researchers at the Fred Hutchinson Research Center to push the boundaries of knowledge in the field.
