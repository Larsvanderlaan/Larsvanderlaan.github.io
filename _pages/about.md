## About me

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Statistics at the University of Washington, advised by [Marco Carone](http://faculty.washington.edu/mcarone/about.html) and [Alex Luedtke](http://www.alexluedtke.com).

My research focuses on causal inference, statistical learning, and semiparametric efficiency theory. I develop methods for debiased and efficient estimation using modern machine learning tools, including doubly robust inference, automatic debiasing, valid inference after model selection, and calibration in causal settings.

I also study model calibration and distribution-free uncertainty quantification more broadly in predictive contexts, and collaborate with [Ahmed Alaa](https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/faculty/ahmed-alaa) (UC Berkeley) on conformal prediction methods.

I am currently supported by a Netflix Graduate Research Fellowship, working with [Nathan Kallus](https://nathankallus.com/) and [Aur√©lien Bibaut](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=N_8WC5oAAAAJ&hl=en) on methods for offline policy evaluation, long-term causal inference from short-term experiments, surrogate endpoints, and causal inference in ill-posed inverse problems.

You can find my [CV](https://larsvanderlaan.github.io/cv/), explore selected [publications](https://larsvanderlaan.github.io/publications/), follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LarsvanderLaan3), or connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lars-van-der-laan-32367615b/). A full list of publications is available on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0bwP0i4AAAAJ&hl=en) profile.
