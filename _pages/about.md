## About me

I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Statistics at the University of Washington, with a strong passion for exploring the intersections of causal inference and debiased machine learning. 

I am advised by Professors [Marco Carone](http://faculty.washington.edu/mcarone/about.html) and [Alex Luedtke](http://www.alexluedtke.com).

My research interests encompass a wide range of areas, including semiparametric statistics, targeted learning, survival analysis, shape-constrained inference, supervised causal statistical learning, distribution-free calibration, and causal inference after model selection. 
 

For the latest updates on my research and academic endeavors, you can follow me on Twitter at [@Larsvanderlaan3](https://twitter.com/LarsvanderLaan3).

 All my research publications can found on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0bwP0i4AAAAJ&hl=en) profile. To explore a selection of my works, please visit the publications tab.
