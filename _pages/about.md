## Personal Statement

I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Statistics at the University of Washington, with a strong passion for exploring the intersections of semiparametric statistics and debiased machine learning. My research interests encompass a wide range of areas, including causal inference, statistical learning, calibration, and inference after model selection. Additionally, I have a keen interest in nonparametric survival analysis and shape-constrained inference with causal inference applications.

For the latest updates on my research and academic endeavors, you can follow me on Twitter at [@Larsvanderlaan3](https://twitter.com/LarsvanderLaan3). To explore a selection of my works, please visit the publications tab.
