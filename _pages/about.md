## About me

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Statistics at the University of Washington, advised by [Marco Carone](http://faculty.washington.edu/mcarone/about.html) and [Alex Luedtke](http://www.alexluedtke.com).

My research focuses on causal inference, statistical learning, and semiparametric efficiency theory.  

I develop methods for debiased and efficient estimation using modern machine learning tools, including doubly robust inference, [automatic debiasing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.11868), inference after model selection, and [heterogeneous treatment effects](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01972).  

A key theme in my work is bridging calibration—traditionally used in prediction—with causal inference, including [causal isotonic calibration](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/van-der-laan23a/van-der-laan23a.pdf), [stabilized inverse probability weighting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.06342), and [calibrated debiased machine learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02771).

I also study [distribution-free uncertainty quantification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05676) in predictive contexts and collaborate with [Ahmed Alaa](https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/faculty/ahmed-alaa) at UC Berkeley—where I am a Visiting Student Researcher—on [conformal prediction](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/file/c1c49aba08e6c90f2b1f85751f497a2f-Paper-Conference.pdf).

I am currently supported by a Netflix Graduate Research Fellowship, and work with [Nathan Kallus](https://nathankallus.com/) and [Aurélien Bibaut](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=N_8WC5oAAAAJ&hl=en) on [offline policy evaluation and reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06926), long-term causal inference from short-term experiments, and instrumental variables.
