## About me

I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Statistics at the University of Washington, with a strong passion for exploring the intersections of causal inference and debiased machine learning. I am advised by [Marco Carone](http://faculty.washington.edu/mcarone/about.html), PhD and [Alex Luedtke](http://www.alexluedtke.com), PhD. For more information about me, please check out my [CV](https://larsvanderlaan.github.io/cv/).


My research interests encompass a wide range of areas, including semi/nonparametric statistics, shape-constrained inference, distribution-free statistical learning and calibration, and inference after model selection. I am enthusiastic about applying these methodologies to various domains, such as survival and longitudinal data analysis, inference on heterogeneous treatment effects, and personalized decision-making.

For the latest updates on my research and academic endeavors, you can follow me on Twitter at [@Larsvanderlaan3](https://twitter.com/LarsvanderLaan3). Additionally, you can access all my research publications on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0bwP0i4AAAAJ&hl=en) profile. To explore a selection of my works, please visit the [publications](https://larsvanderlaan.github.io/publications/) tab.
