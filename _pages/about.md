## About me
I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Statistics at the University of Washington, advised by [Marco Carone](http://faculty.washington.edu/mcarone/about.html) and [Alex Luedtke](http://www.alexluedtke.com). My research focuses on causal inference, statistical learning, and semiparametric efficiency theory. I develop methods for debiased and efficient estimation using modern machine learning tools, including techniques for doubly robust inference, automatic debiasing, and valid inference after data-driven model selection. I also work on developing methods for model calibration and uncertainty quantification—particularly in causal settings—and collaborate with [Ahmed Alaa](https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/faculty/ahmed-alaa) (UC Berkeley) on conformal prediction. Motivating applications include survival and longitudinal analysis, individualized treatment decisions, and policy evaluation in dynamic settings.

I am currently supported by a Netflix Graduate Research Fellowship, working with [Nathan Kallus](https://nathankallus.com/) and [Aurelien Bibaut](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=N_8WC5oAAAAJ&hl=en) on methods for offline policy evaluation in Markov decision processes, long-term causal inference from short-term experiments, instrumental variables and surrogate endpoints, and causal inference in ill-posed inverse problems.
