## About me

I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Statistics at the University of Washington, advised by [Marco Carone](http://faculty.washington.edu/mcarone/about.html) and [Alex Luedtke](http://www.alexluedtke.com).

My research focuses on **causal inference, statistical learning, and semiparametric efficiency theory**. I develop methods for debiased and efficient estimation with modern machine learning, including [doubly robust inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02771), [automatic debiasing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.11868), inference after [model selection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.12544), and [heterogeneous treatment effects](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01972).

I am supported by a Netflix Graduate Research Fellowship, collaborating with [Nathan Kallus](https://nathankallus.com/) and [Aurélien Bibaut](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=N_8WC5oAAAAJ&hl=en) on **reinforcement learning and dynamic decision making** ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06926)) and **nonparametric instrumental variables inference** ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07729)). This work tackles challenges such as estimating long-term causal effects from short-term experiments.

Another line of research connects **calibration** with **causal inference**, including [causal isotonic calibration](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/van-der-laan23a/van-der-laan23a.pdf) for CATE predictors, [stabilized weighting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.06342), [Bellman calibration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06926) for reinforcement learning, and [doubly robust inference via calibration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02771).

I also study **machine learning methods for predictive inference**, such as [conformal prediction](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/file/c1c49aba08e6c90f2b1f85751f497a2f-Paper-Conference.pdf) and [generalized Venn–Abers calibration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05676) (with [Ahmed Alaa](https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/faculty/ahmed-alaa), UC Berkeley).

Beyond methodology, I apply these ideas in biomedical and technology domains through internships at Genentech, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, and Netflix. I also contribute to the [tlverse](https://tlverse.org) open-source software ecosystem and consult for [TLRevolution](https://www.tlrevolution.com).
