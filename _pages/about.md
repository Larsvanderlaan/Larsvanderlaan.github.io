## About me

I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Statistics at the University of Washington, with a strong passion for exploring the intersections of causal inference and debiased machine learning. 

My research interests encompass a wide range of areas, including semiparametric statistics, survival analysis, shape-constrained inference, supervised statistical learning, distribution-free calibration, and inference after model selection. 
 

For the latest updates on my research and academic endeavors, you can follow me on Twitter at [@Larsvanderlaan3](https://twitter.com/LarsvanderLaan3).
